The UAID can be found on the top most dashboard of your Google Analytics account. It is written in small text next to each one of your domain names, and looks something like this `UA-74368483-3`. For further assistance, check out the Screenshots page for a visual guide.

= I am new to Analytics. Does this plugin do everything for me? =

Before Google Analytics will begin tracking, your profile needs to be verified. To verify your profile, log into your Google Analytics account, then click on the Admin tab, then click on the Tracking Code tab. If you installed the plugin correctly (see Installation tab), just visiting this page should verify your profile.
